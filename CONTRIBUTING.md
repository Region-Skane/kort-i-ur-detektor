## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if a PR should be merged we (maintainers and Region SkÃ¥ne) will look at the following things:

### Does the PR got a clear intent

You should be clear what you're trying to solve with your
contribution and why.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that.

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is the PR of good quality

  - There are no spelling mistakes
  - The code builds in the pipeline
  - All checks in the pipeline are ok

### Does the PR follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and we will
remove things not following it.
